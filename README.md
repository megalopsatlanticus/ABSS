# ABSS
Automated Biological Sampling System
###Welcome to ABBS, your next generation Population Analysis Tool###

ABBS is a system for sampling biological populations. We say system, because it is. However it is user-deployable, and the source code open-source if you have access to the necessary components. 

In Western lotic systems, our first iteration was a "boogie-board" with a hole cut in it and a 360 degree action camera stuck through it. 

In terrestrial systems, we started with basic rotary wing UAS. We have no graduated to testing it with fixed wing unmanned aircraft. However it can be quite effective when deployed with a rotary-wing UAS over gathering ungulates. 

A full suite of training images for Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo trutta, Oncorhynchus clarkii sp., Cervus canadensis nelsoni, Antilocapra americana, and Odocoileus hemionus are available. However delivery would be most convenient for me on a physical drive, delivered to you at no profit (cost of shipping and drive). 

Currently deployment is a little clunky and requires scripting. However we hope to have a forward-facing application soon.
